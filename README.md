# Scripts for Approximate Bayesian Computation in population genomics 

* Generating simulations under various coalescent programs from a config file
* Calculate summary statistics from an ms-formatted file using multiprocessing
* Calculate summary statistics (observed) from VCF and FASTA files

Not everything is documented yet, but most scripts have some helpful information if you type `python script.py -h`.

**TODO**
- Detailed README and Examples
- More informative doc-strings
- abc_stats: add tests (known stats values)
- abc_sims: add tests, msprime as default with debugger
- abc_sims: add SLiM support using pyslim
- set logging: selected options, errors, warnings, demography debugger
